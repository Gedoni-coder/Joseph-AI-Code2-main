Total revenue streams are performing well with ${streamsLength} active channels contributing to top-line growth. Revenue mix shows healthy diversification across customer segments and product lines, reducing dependency on any single source.

2. KEY REVENUE METRICS
Revenue per customer and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) are tracking favorably against targets. Average customer lifetime value has improved through enhanced retention and upsell programs. Gross margin remains strong at industry-leading levels.

3. GROWTH DRIVERS

4. CUSTOMER RETENTION
Churn analysis shows stable retention rates with ${churnLength} customer cohorts being actively managed. Cohort analysis reveals improving retention in newer customer segments as onboarding and success processes mature.

5. EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES
Analysis identifies ${upsellsLength} high-probability upsell and cross-sell opportunities that could generate incremental revenue of $${INCREMENTAL_REVENUE_ESTIMATE} annually without requiring new customer acquisition.`;
