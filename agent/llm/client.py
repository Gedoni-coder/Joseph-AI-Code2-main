"""
LLM Client Wrapper

Abstraction layer for language model interactions:
- OpenAI / Claude / other LLM provider support
- Prompt templating and formatting
- Response parsing and validation
- Streaming and batch processing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error handling (rate limits, timeouts)
- Request/response logging
- Model parameter configuration (temperature, top_p, etc.)
- Multi-model support (reasoning vs fast inference)

Provides a clean interface for the agent to interact with LLMs.
