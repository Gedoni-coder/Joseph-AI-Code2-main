Content Normalization & Structuring

Third stage of document processing pipeline:
- Text cleaning (remove noise, fix encoding)
- Standardize dates, currencies, units
- Extract and normalize key-value pairs
- Business rule validation
- Data type conversion
- Deduplication detection
- Format standardization (address, phone, etc.)
- Predefined information extraction based on document type

Outputs clean, structured data ready for storage and use by downstream systems.
