Context Retrieval Logic

Retrieves relevant context from knowledge sources to ground agent reasoning:
- Semantic search over documents
- Historical data lookup
- Economic intelligence retrieval
- User preference and history retrieval
- Business rule and constraint lookup

Core to the RAG brain - every reasoning decision is grounded in retrieved context.
