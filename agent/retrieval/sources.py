Knowledge Sources Management

Manages all data sources that feed the RAG brain:
- Database connections for business data
- Document storage (processed user uploads)
- Scraped economic data repositories
- Historical insights and derived knowledge
- User preferences and context
- System configuration and rules

Abstracts source access patterns so retriever.py can work with diverse backends.
