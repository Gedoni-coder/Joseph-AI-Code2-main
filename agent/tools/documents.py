"""
Document Processor - User Upload Handling

Triggered when users upload documents:
- Reads documents (PDF, spreadsheet, text, etc.)
- Extracts predefined information types
- Normalizes and validates data
- Stores structured outputs
- Pushes results to relevant system APIs
- Triggers follow-up actions if needed

Document upload is the implicit trigger - no explicit "analyze this" needed.
